Enable CGI Scripts in the Apache Configurations
Overview: Two things need to be set up, in order to run CGI scripts on a Linux server with Apache:

Apache needs to be configured to allow CGI scripts to run.
The script needs to be uploaded to the correct location, and given the correct permissions.

Apache Settings for CGI Scripts on CentOS 7

Open the httpd.conf file for editing:

sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.confmixed

"""
Find the section which reads:
"""

#
# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
#
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Require all granted
</Directory>mixed

"""
Add the following two lines to this section:
"""

Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .pymixed

"""
The first line tells Apache to execute CGI files which are uploaded to the /var/www/cgi-bin directory. The second line tells Apache that any file ending in .cgi, .pl, or .py is considered a CGI script.
"""

The section now reads:

#
# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
#
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
    Require all granted
</Directory>

"""
Save and exit the file. Then restart Apache so that the changes take effect:
"""

sudo systemctl restart httpdmixed

Apache Settings for CGI Scripts on Ubuntu 16.04
On Ubuntu 16.04, Apache is configured by default to allow the execution of CGI scripts in the designated /usr/lib/cgi-bin directory. You will not need to change any Apache configurations.

However, Apache's CGI module will need to be enabled before CGI scripts can run. To do this, you will need to create a symlink:

sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ mixed
Then restart Apache so that the changes take effect:

sudo systemctl restart apache2
